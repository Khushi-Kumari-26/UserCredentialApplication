# UserCredentialApplication
"UserCredentialApplication is a Java web application repository designed to facilitate user registration, login, and account management functionalities. It includes eight HTML pages: home, login, register , create, deposit , withdraw , display , and success, each serving specific purposes in the user journey.

The application is powered by seven servlets:

DbconnectionServlet: Handles database connection establishment.
RegisterServlet: Manages user registration process.
LoginServlet: Facilitates user login functionality.
CreateServlet: Manages account creation, deposit, and withdrawal operations.
DepositServlet: Used to deposit money on account.
WithdrawServlet: Used to retrieve Balance from an account.
DisplayServlet: Retrieves and displays user account details.
The user begins by accessing the home page, where options to register and login are available. If the user is already registered, they are directed to the login page directly. Upon successful registration, users can perform account operations such as depositing and withdrawing funds, and view their account details.

The application ensures a seamless user experience by allowing users to exit the application securely through the logout option. With intuitive navigation and comprehensive functionalities, UserCredentialApplication provides a robust platform for managing user accounts effectively."
